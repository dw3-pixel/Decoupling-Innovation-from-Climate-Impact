 Key Findings
 
The initial strong negative correlation between SDG 9 and SDG 13 was found to be misleading. The final Multiple Linear Regression model demonstrated that SDG 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production) is the statistically significant driver of poor climate action scores, while the direct effect of SDG 9 is negligible when SDG 12 is controlled.
